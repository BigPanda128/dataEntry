Data entry assignment
2/15/2013

Enter data of 25 specific things with 5 attributes each. Im useing the JSON format.

I chose to enter in data for each of the premium tanks in one of my favorit video games World of Tanks. Thier is 33 of them and i am going to enter in what nationality they are. The class of each of them. The top speed in km/h. The gun caliber in mm. And finally the penetration of the gun in mm as well. I plan to list all of this in JSON format becasue it seemed to be the most straight forward to me. This information will help be narrow down tanks that can go over a certain speed, tanks from a specific nation, or even sort them based on tank class. the possibilities are endless when wanting to narrow down what premium tank you are looking for.
I can use the filter function to search the list for any specific nation, gun caliber, tank type etc.
I plan to use the map function to sumulate the reoval of a govner on an engine and that would add 5% to all tanks top speed.
And to reduce i could narrow it down to the single tank that has the highest damage or top speed amoung a certain tank type.
