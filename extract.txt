you can easily filter out any of the information stored in the data set. tanks
of a specific nation, tanks with a speed above or below somthing, tanks with a
certain size calibur gun, average alpha damage. 
As for the mapping i could only
come up with one way map in this data set. And that is to add 5% to all speeds
to take in account for removal of the govner on each tank.
